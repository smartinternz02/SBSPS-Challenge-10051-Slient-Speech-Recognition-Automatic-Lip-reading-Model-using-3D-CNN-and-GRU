Slient Speech Recognition : Automatic Lip reading Model using 3D CNN and GRU

Install the necessary requirements with  "pip install -r requirements.txt"

Used python version -> 3.9.17 

conda syntax : "conda create --name <environment_name> python==3.9 anaconda"    

Go to the WebApp folder and run "streamlit run app.py" to execute the website with streamlit 

Under the models folder there contains different model checkpoints in which  "best_model" is the latest training checkpoint this produced maximum effeciency as per our validation. 

NOTE : only 20 Computational Unit Hours are allowed in Lite plan of IBM Watson Machine Learning, Thus kindly use the resource wisely as API rejection occurs once 20CUH per month limit crosses (it takes around 0.5 CUH per request!)
